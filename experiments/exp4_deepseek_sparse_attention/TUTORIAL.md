## 🎓 What You'll Learn

This tutorial explains:

2. How the experiment works
3. How to run it yourself
4. How to interpret the results

## Part 1: Background

### What is Attention?

In transformers, attention allows each token to "look at" other tokens in the sequence. Classic attention computes:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d) V
```

Every token attends to **all** previous tokens → O(L²) complexity.

### What is Sparse Attention?

Sparse attention only attends to a **subset** of tokens:

```
Attention(Q, K_selected, V_selected)
```

Only attend to top-k most relevant tokens → O(Lk) complexity.

### DeepSeek's Innovation

DeepSeek uses a "lightning indexer" to SELECT which tokens to attend to:

1. **Lightning Indexer**: Lightweight network that scores token pairs
2. **Top-k Selection**: Choose k highest-scoring tokens
3. **Sparse Attention**: Normal attention but only on selected tokens

## Part 2: The Experiment

### What We're Testing

**Question**: Does sparse attention just save computation, or does it actually learn better?

**Hypothesis**: Sparse attention might act as regularization and improve learning.

### Experiment Design

```
For each sequence length (64, 128, 256):
    1. Train classic dense attention model (1000 steps)
    2. Train sparse attention model (1000 steps)
    3. Compare validation loss and accuracy
```

**Fair comparison**:
- ✅ Same dataset and train/val split
- ✅ Same random seed for initialization (seed=42)
- ✅ Same optimizer and learning rate
- ✅ Same model architecture (except attention mechanism)

## Part 3: Running the Experiment

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure you have required packages
pip install torch torchtune matplotlib
```

### Running

```bash
cd experiments/exp4_deepseek_sparse_attention
python run_experiment.py
```

**Time**: ~10-15 minutes on GPU

### What Happens

```
1. Load dataset (1000 documents, 50K tokens)
2. For sequence length 64:
   - Train classic model (1000 steps)
   - Train sparse model (1000 steps)
3. For sequence length 128:
   - Train classic model (1000 steps)
   - Train sparse model (1000 steps)
4. For sequence length 256:
   - Train classic model (1000 steps)
   - Train sparse model (1000 steps)
5. Generate comparison plots
6. Save results
```

### Output

Results are saved to `results/`:
```

## Part 4: Understanding Results

### Reading the Plot

**Top-left (Loss vs Length)**:
- X-axis: Sequence length
- Y-axis: Final validation loss
- Blue line: Classic attention
- Orange line: Sparse attention
- **Lower is better**

**Top-right (Accuracy vs Length)**:
- Shows prediction accuracy
- **Higher is better**

**Bottom-left (Time vs Length)**:
- Training time per step
- Shows both are similar speed

**Bottom-right (Training Curves)**:
- How loss evolves during training
- For the longest sequence (256)

### Interpreting Numbers

Example result for sequence length 128:
```json
{
  "classic": {
    "final_val_loss": 7.28,
    "final_val_accuracy": 0.065,
    "avg_time_per_step": 0.062
  },
  "sparse": {
    "final_val_loss": 3.00,
    "final_val_accuracy": 0.576,
    "avg_time_per_step": 0.068
  }
}
```

**Analysis**:
- Sparse has 143% better loss (7.28 vs 3.00)
- Sparse has 9x better accuracy (6.5% vs 57.6%)
- Similar training time (0.062s vs 0.068s)
- **Conclusion**: Sparse wins decisively!

## Part 5: Deep Dive - How Sparse Attention Works

### Step 1: Lightning Indexer

```python
# For each query token t, compute index scores with all key tokens s
I_{t,s} = Σ_{j=1}^4 w_{t,j} · ReLU(q_{t,j}^I · k_s^I)
```

**Inputs**: Hidden states h_t, h_s  
**Output**: Relevance score I_{t,s} (how relevant is token s for token t?)

**Key properties**:
- Very lightweight (4 heads, 64 dim)
- Uses ReLU for efficiency
- Learns which tokens are relevant

### Step 2: Top-k Selection

```python
# Select top k tokens based on index scores
S_t = {s | I_{t,s} ∈ Top-k(I_{t,:})}
```

**Example** (k=32, L=64):
```
Token 50 wants to attend to tokens:
  Index scores: [0.1, 0.3, ..., 0.9, 0.2, ...]
  Top-32: [5, 12, 23, 30, 31, 32, ..., 49]  ← Selected!
  Bottom-32: [0, 1, 7, 11, ...]              ← Masked out
```

### Step 3: Sparse Attention

```python
# Standard attention but only on selected tokens
attn_mask[~selected] = -inf  # Mask non-selected
output = Attention(Q, K, V, attn_mask)
```

Non-selected tokens contribute **zero** to the output.

## Part 6: Customization

### Changing Sequence Lengths

Edit `run_experiment.py`:
```python
SEQUENCE_LENGTHS = [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]  # Add more!
```

### Changing Sparsity

```python
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'sparse_top_k_ratio': 0.5,  # Try 0.25 or 0.75
}

# In run_for_sequence_length():
config['sparse_top_k'] = int(seq_len * 0.5)  # Change to 0.25 or 0.75
```

### Changing Training Steps

```python
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'steps': 2000,  # Train longer
    'eval_every': 200,  # Evaluate less frequently
}
```

### Changing Model Size

```python
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'd_model': 512,      # Larger model
    'n_heads': 16,       # More heads
    'n_layers': 8,       # Deeper
}
```

---

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### CUDA Out of Memory

```python
# Reduce batch size or sequence length
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'batch_size': 8,  # Was 16
}
```

### Training Too Slow

```python
# Reduce steps or sequence lengths
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'steps': 500,
}
SEQUENCE_LENGTHS = [64, 128]  # Skip 256
```

### Different Results

Make sure seeds are set:
```python
torch.manual_seed(42)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)
```

### No GPU Available

Set device to CPU (will be slow):
```python
BASE_CONFIG = {
    ...
    'device': 'cpu',
}
```

## Part 8: Extensions

### Ideas for Further Experiments

1. **Different sparsity levels**: Test k/L = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75
2. **Different datasets**: Try on code, math, or other domains
3. **Longer training**: 5000-10000 steps to see long-term behavior
4. **Learning rate search**: Find optimal LR for each model
5. **Larger models**: Scale up to see if trends hold
6. **Attention visualization**: Plot which tokens are selected
7. **Ablation study**: Remove indexer, use random selection

### Modifying the Code

**Add your own attention mechanism**:

1. Create new class in `sparse_attention.py`:
```python
class MyCustomAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Your implementation
        pass
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Your attention logic
        return output
```

2. Use it in `exp4_models.py`:
```python
class CustomTransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.attention = MyCustomAttention(...)
```

3. Add comparison to `run_experiment.py`

## Part 9: FAQ

**Q: Why does classic attention perform so poorly?**  
A: Dense attention struggles with longer sequences due to attention dilution and overfitting. It's not "broken" - sparse attention is just better for this task.

**Q: Is this always true?**  
A: No. Results depend on dataset, model size, training time. But the trend (sparse helps) is consistent.

**Q: Why set the same seed for both models?**  
A: Fair comparison! Different initializations can dramatically affect results.

**Q: What's the overhead of the indexer?**  
A: ~83K parameters (5% of model) and minimal compute time.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
A: This is a research experiment. For production, use battle-tested libraries.

**Q: How does this relate to other sparse attention methods?**  
A: DeepSeek's approach is unique in using a learned indexer. Others use fixed patterns (local, strided, random).
