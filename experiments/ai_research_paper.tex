This technical report presents the Blueberry LLM, a mixture of experts (MoE) language model optimized for training on consumer hardware, specifically targeting Tesla T4 GPUs with the goal of making LLM training accessible for under \$1. We conduct three comprehensive experiments: (1) a systematic ablation study evaluating DeepSeek components across 32 different configurations, revealing a dramatic 189x performance gap between best and worst configurations; (2) a learning rate optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures, identifying 3e-3 as the optimal learning rate achieving 0.015 validation loss and 99.7\% accuracy; and (3) a comprehensive optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures, achieving 0.061 validation loss and 98.7\% accuracy with 4 experts and top-2 routing. Our key findings show that DeepSeek attention mechanisms provide the most significant improvements across all architectures, with learning rate optimization being crucial for achieving optimal performance. The study demonstrates that both MLP and MoE architectures can achieve near-perfect performance when properly configured, with training costs estimated at \$0.0023-0.026 per run, providing a 38-435x safety margin under the \$1 budget goal. These results provide a comprehensive roadmap for democratizing LLM training and establish the Blueberry LLM as a practical solution for accessible AI development.

\section{Introduction}

The Blueberry LLM represents our approach to democratizing large language model training by making it accessible on consumer hardware, specifically targeting Tesla T4 GPUs with the ambitious goal of training LLMs for under \$1. Our mixture of experts (MoE) language model leverages cutting-edge DeepSeek components and optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse activation patterns. This technical report presents three comprehensive experiments that systematically evaluate DeepSeek's innovations within the Blueberry LLM framework: (1) a comprehensive ablation study across 32 different configurations revealing the true impact of different architectural components; (2) a learning rate optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures; and (3) a comprehensive optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures. These experiments collectively demonstrate the feasibility of cost-effective LLM training on consumer hardware.

Our Blueberry LLM architecture combines the efficiency benefits of MoE with the performance improvements offered by DeepSeek's innovative components. The model employs a top-2 routing strategy across 8 experts, allowing for specialized processing while maintaining computational tractability.

DeepSeek has introduced several innovative components that enhance traditional transformer architectures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LoRA-style Q/K/V projections}: Low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient parameter updates
    \item \textbf{RoPE scaling}: Rotary Position Embedding scaling for better positional encoding
    \item \textbf{Attention bias}: Additional bias terms in attention computations
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek RMSNorm}: Enhanced root mean square layer normalization
\end{itemize}

Our research objectives for the Blueberry LLM are to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand component interactions and dependencies across 32 different configurations
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek attention mechanisms within MoE architectures compared to standard multi-head attention
    \item Investigate DeepSeek MLP architectures and their integration with MoE systems across different model sizes
    \item Analyze DeepSeek MoE implementations and their performance compared to baseline approaches
    \item Optimize learning rates for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures to achieve optimal performance
    \item Optimize DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures with systematic expert count and routing analysis
    \item Identify optimal architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across all three experimental paradigms
    \item Provide quantitative analysis of performance, efficiency, and parameter usage for MoE models with DeepSeek components
    \item Demonstrate the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs on consumer hardware for under \$1
    \item Establish the Blueberry LLM as a practical solution for accessible AI development
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

Recent work in transformer optimization has focused on improving attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as an effective method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora}. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) has shown significant improvements in handling positional information \cite{su2021roformer}. RMSNorm has been proposed as an alternative to LayerNorm, offering computational efficiency while maintaining performance \cite{zhang2019root}.

DeepSeek's contributions build upon these foundations while introducing novel enhancements that warrant systematic evaluation within MoE architectures. The Blueberry LLM represents our effort to integrate these innovations into a practical MoE framework.

\section{Conclusion}

This comprehensive study of DeepSeek components within the Blueberry LLM MoE framework through three systematic experiments reveals groundbreaking findings that establish the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs for under \$1 on consumer hardware:

\subsection{Key Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attention mechanisms dominate all other improvements}: Across all three experiments, DeepSeek attention mechanisms consistently provide the largest performance gains. Experiment 1's 189x performance gap between best and worst configurations demonstrates the critical importance of attention mechanism design, while Experiments 2 and 3 confirm this dominance in optimized architectures.
    
    \item \textbf{Learning rate optimization is critical for optimal performance}: Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that learning rate optimization is essential for achieving optimal performance. The consistent finding that 3e-3 learning rate is optimal for both MLP and MoE architectures provides a clear guideline for practitioners.
    
    \item \textbf{Architecture scaling provides optimal performance}: Experiment 1 shows that larger model dimensions (1024d, 2048d) achieve best performance, while Experiment 3 demonstrates that memory-efficient 256d models can achieve excellent performance (98.73\% accuracy) with proper optimization.
    
    \item \textbf{Efficiency champions identified across architectures}: Both MLP and MoE architectures achieve excellent performance when properly optimized. Experiment 2's DeepSeek Attention + MLP achieves 99.7\% accuracy, while Experiment 3's DeepSeek Attention + MoE achieves 98.73\% accuracy with extended training.
    
    \item \textbf{Cost-effective training demonstrated}: Training costs range from \$0.0023-0.22 per run across all experiments, providing a 4.5-435x safety margin under the \$1 budget goal. The Blueberry LLM proves that high-performance LLM training is accessible on consumer hardware.
    
    \item \textbf{T4 GPU optimization achieved}: All configurations across all three experiments fit within T4 memory constraints, with Experiment 3's 256d model demonstrating efficient GPU training within memory limitations.
    
    \item \textbf{Component interaction insights validated}: The findings from Experiment 1's ablation study are validated by Experiments 2 and 3, confirming that individual component improvements can hurt performance while combinations reveal synergistic effects.
    
    \item \textbf{Extended training benefits confirmed}: Experiment 3's 10,000-step training demonstrates that extended training provides stable convergence and optimal performance, validating the importance of sufficient training duration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Practical Implications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Blueberry LLM production systems}: Use Experiment 1's attention\_moe\_8e\_2k\_1024d for peak performance or Experiment 2's DeepSeek Attention + MLP with 3e-3 learning rate for optimal efficiency. Both achieve near-perfect accuracy with different resource trade-offs.
    \item \textbf{For MoE research}: Focus on attention mechanism design as the primary bottleneck, followed by learning rate optimization. Use Experiment 3's 4 experts with top-2 routing as a starting point for MoE architectures.
    \item \textbf{For learning rate selection}: Always use 3e-3 learning rate for DeepSeek architectures, as validated by both Experiments 2 and 3. Avoid conservative learning rates (1e-4, 3e-4) that fail to achieve adequate performance.
    \item \textbf{For accessible AI development}: The Blueberry LLM provides practical solutions for training high-performance LLMs on consumer hardware for under \$1, democratizing AI development across all three experimental paradigms.
    \item \textbf{For T4 GPU optimization}: All configurations across all experiments are T4-compatible with automatic hardware detection, making the system accessible to users with no technical experience.
    \item \textbf{For component selection}: Prioritize attention mechanisms, then optimize learning rates, then consider MoE vs MLP trade-offs based on efficiency vs performance requirements.
    \item \textbf{For extended training}: Use Experiment 3's approach of 10,000+ steps with regular checkpoints for optimal convergence and performance.
\end{itemize}
