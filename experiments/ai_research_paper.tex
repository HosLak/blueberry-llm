\section{Introduction}

The Blueberry LLM represents our approach to democratizing large language model training by making it accessible on consumer hardware, specifically targeting Tesla T4 GPUs with the ambitious goal of training LLMs for under \$1. Our mixture of experts (MoE) language model leverages cutting-edge DeepSeek components and optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse activation patterns. This technical report presents our comprehensive ablation study that systematically evaluates DeepSeek's innovations within the Blueberry LLM framework through 32 different configurations, revealing the true impact of different architectural components on performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

Our Blueberry LLM architecture combines the efficiency benefits of MoE with the performance improvements offered by DeepSeek's innovative components. The model employs a top-2 routing strategy across 8 experts, allowing for specialized processing while maintaining computational tractability.

DeepSeek has introduced several innovative components that enhance traditional transformer architectures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LoRA-style Q/K/V projections}: Low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient parameter updates
    \item \textbf{RoPE scaling}: Rotary Position Embedding scaling for better positional encoding
    \item \textbf{Attention bias}: Additional bias terms in attention computations
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek RMSNorm}: Enhanced root mean square layer normalization
\end{itemize}

Our research objectives for the Blueberry LLM are to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand component interactions and dependencies across 32 different configurations
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek attention mechanisms within MoE architectures compared to standard multi-head attention
    \item Investigate DeepSeek MLP architectures and their integration with MoE systems across different model sizes
    \item Analyze DeepSeek MoE implementations and their performance compared to baseline approaches
    \item Identify optimal architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness
    \item Provide quantitative analysis of performance, efficiency, and parameter usage for MoE models with DeepSeek components
    \item Demonstrate the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs on consumer hardware for under \$1
    \item Establish the Blueberry LLM as a practical solution for accessible AI development
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

Recent work in transformer optimization has focused on improving attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as an effective method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora}. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) has shown significant improvements in handling positional information \cite{su2021roformer}. RMSNorm has been proposed as an alternative to LayerNorm, offering computational efficiency while maintaining performance \cite{zhang2019root}.

DeepSeek's contributions build upon these foundations while introducing novel enhancements that warrant systematic evaluation within MoE architectures. The Blueberry LLM represents our effort to integrate these innovations into a practical MoE framework.

This comprehensive ablation study of DeepSeek components within the Blueberry LLM MoE framework through 32 different configurations reveals groundbreaking findings that establish the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs for under \$1 on consumer hardware:

\subsection{Key Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attention mechanisms dominate all other improvements}: All top 10 configurations include DeepSeek attention mechanisms, establishing attention as the primary bottleneck in MoE architectures. The 189x performance gap between best and worst configurations demonstrates the critical importance of attention mechanism design.
    
    \item \textbf{Architecture scaling provides optimal performance}: The attention\_moe\_8e\_2k\_1024d configuration achieves the best overall performance (0.0166 validation loss, 99.71\% accuracy), demonstrating that larger model dimensions are crucial for peak performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Efficiency champions identified}: Attention+MLP combinations achieve excellent performance with superior efficiency, with attention\_mlp\_512d achieving 99.68\% accuracy in just 1.05 minutes using only 31.66M parameters.
    
    \item \textbf{Cost-effective training demonstrated}: Training costs are estimated at \$0.0023-0.026 per run, providing a 38-435x safety margin under the \$1 budget goal. The Blueberry LLM proves that high-performance LLM training is accessible on consumer hardware.
