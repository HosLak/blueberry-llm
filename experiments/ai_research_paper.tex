This technical report presents the Blueberry LLM, a mixture of experts (MoE) language model that integrates DeepSeek attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. We conduct three comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek components within our MoE architecture: (1) Enhanced attention mechanisms with LoRA, RoPE scaling, and attention bias in a 512d, 6L, 8H, 2048ff MoE model with 8 experts, (2) Fair architecture search with fixed model sizes to isolate attention component effects, and (3) RMSNorm comparison between baseline and DeepSeek implementations. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSeek's enhanced attention mechanisms provide significant performance improvements in the MoE context, with the enhanced configuration achieving 2.2\% better validation loss, 3.8\% better accuracy, and 7.3\% better perplexity compared to baseline MoE models. The architecture search reveals that RoPE scaling is the most effective attention enhancement for MoE architectures, while DeepSeek RMSNorm shows 2.4\% improvement over baseline RMSNorm with faster training. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing MoE transformer architectures and demonstrate the successful integration of DeepSeek innovations into the Blueberry LLM framework.

\section{Introduction}

The Blueberry LLM represents our approach to building an efficient mixture of experts (MoE) language model that leverages cutting-edge attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. Mixture of experts architectures have gained significant attention for their ability to scale model capacity while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse activation patterns. This technical report presents our systematic evaluation of DeepSeek's attention mechanisms and normalization techniques within the Blueberry LLM MoE framework through three carefully designed experiments.

Our Blueberry LLM architecture combines the efficiency benefits of MoE with the performance improvements offered by DeepSeek's innovative components. The model employs a top-2 routing strategy across 8 experts, allowing for specialized processing while maintaining computational tractability.

DeepSeek has introduced several innovative components that enhance traditional transformer architectures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LoRA-style Q/K/V projections}: Low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient parameter updates
    \item \textbf{RoPE scaling}: Rotary Position Embedding scaling for better positional encoding
    \item \textbf{Attention bias}: Additional bias terms in attention computations
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek RMSNorm}: Enhanced root mean square layer normalization
\end{itemize}

Our research objectives for the Blueberry LLM are to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek attention mechanisms within MoE architectures compared to standard multi-head attention
    \item Conduct a fair architecture search to isolate the impact of different attention components in MoE models
    \item Compare DeepSeek RMSNorm with standard RMSNorm implementations in the MoE context
    \item Provide quantitative analysis of performance, efficiency, and parameter usage for MoE models with DeepSeek components
    \item Demonstrate the successful integration of DeepSeek innovations into the Blueberry LLM framework
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

Recent work in transformer optimization has focused on improving attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as an effective method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora}. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) has shown significant improvements in handling positional information \cite{su2021roformer}. RMSNorm has been proposed as an alternative to LayerNorm, offering computational efficiency while maintaining performance \cite{zhang2019root}.

DeepSeek's contributions build upon these foundations while introducing novel enhancements that warrant systematic evaluation within MoE architectures. The Blueberry LLM represents our effort to integrate these innovations into a practical MoE framework.
