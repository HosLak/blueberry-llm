This experiment conducted a simplified ablation study focused on 512 hidden dimension scale with 5 different model configurations to evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek components (Attention and MLP) and GLM4 MoE architectures.

## Experimental Setup
- **Training Steps**: 1,500 per model
- **Hidden Dimension**: 512 (target scale)
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Sequence Length**: 256
- **Models Tested**: 5 configurations

## Model Configurations

| Model | Architecture | Parameters (M) | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `baseline` | Standard MoE | 53.49 | Control group (no DeepSeek components) |
| `mlp_512d` | DeepSeek MLP | 37.75 | DeepSeek MLP only (512d â†’ 2048d) |
| `attention_mlp_512d` | DeepSeek Attn+MLP | 36.28 | DeepSeek Attention + MLP |
| `moe_8e_2k_512d` | GLM4 MoE | 232.89 | GLM4 MoE (8 experts, top-2) |
| `attention_moe_8e_2k_512d` | DeepSeek Attn+GLM4 MoE | 231.42 | DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE |

## Results Summary

### Performance Rankings (by Validation Loss)

| Rank | Model | Val Loss | Val Accuracy | Val Perplexity | Training Time (min) |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `attention_moe_8e_2k_512d` | **0.0172** | 0.9967 | 1.02 | 1.62 |
| 2 | `attention_mlp_512d` | **0.0174** | 0.9971 | 1.02 | 1.13 |
| 3 | `moe_8e_2k_512d` | 0.1097 | 0.9795 | 1.12 | 1.59 |
| 4 | `baseline` | 0.1203 | 0.9775 | 1.13 | 2.21 |
| 5 | `mlp_512d` | 0.1508 | 0.9722 | 1.16 | 0.93 |

### Key Findings

1. **DeepSeek Attention Dominance**: Models with DeepSeek Attention (`attention_mlp_512d`, `attention_moe_8e_2k_512d`) achieved the best performance with validation losses ~0.017, significantly outperforming models without DeepSeek Attention.

2. **Performance Gap**: There's a substantial performance gap between models with and without DeepSeek Attention:
   - **With DeepSeek Attention**: 0.0172-0.0174 validation loss
   - **Without DeepSeek Attention**: 0.1097-0.1508 validation loss
   - **Improvement**: ~6-9x better performance

3. **MoE vs MLP**: At this scale, DeepSeek MLP (`attention_mlp_512d`) performed nearly identically to DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE (`attention_moe_8e_2k_512d`), suggesting that the DeepSeek Attention component is the primary driver of performance gains.

4. **Parameter Efficiency**: The `attention_mlp_512d` model achieved top-tier performance with only 36.28M parameters, making it the most parameter-efficient solution.

5. **Training Efficiency**: All models converged within 1-2 minutes, with `mlp_512d` being the fastest (0.93 min) and `baseline` being the slowest (2.21 min).

## Research Paper Implications

### For LaTeX Research Paper:

**Abstract Summary**: "Our simplified ablation study on 512-dimensional models demonstrates that DeepSeek Attention components provide 6-9x improvement in validation loss compared to baseline architectures, with DeepSeek Attention + MLP achieving near-optimal performance at 36.28M parameters."

**Key Statistics**:
- Best performing model: `attention_moe_8e_2k_512d` (0.0172 validation loss)
- Most efficient model: `attention_mlp_512d` (0.0174 validation loss, 36.28M parameters)
- Performance improvement: 6-9x over baseline
- Training time: 0.93-2.21 minutes per model

**Conclusion**: DeepSeek Attention components are the primary driver of performance improvements in this architecture scale, with MoE providing minimal additional benefit when combined with DeepSeek Attention.
