# Experiment 1: DeepSeek Attention Integration

## Overview

This experiment integrates DeepSeek's advanced attention mechanisms into our MoE model to evaluate their impact on performance and efficiency.

## DeepSeek Attention Features

### 1. LoRA-style Q/K/V Projections
- **Q Projection**: Optional LoRA-style projection with configurable rank
- **KV Projection**: LoRA-style projection with MQA (Multi-Query Attention) support
- **Benefits**: Reduced parameters, improved efficiency

### 2. Separate Head Dimensions
- **QK Head Dim**: Configurable dimension for query/key projections
- **V Head Dim**: Configurable dimension for value projections
- **Benefits**: Allows optimization of different attention components

### 3. Advanced RoPE Scaling
- **Linear Scaling**: Simple linear scaling of RoPE frequencies
- **Dynamic NTK Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on sequence length
- **YARN Scaling**: Advanced scaling with multiple parameters
- **Benefits**: Better handling of long sequences

### 4. Flash Attention 2 Support
- **Flash Attention**: Memory-efficient attention implementation
- **Benefits**: Reduced memory usage, faster training

### 5. Enhanced Attention Bias
- **Configurable Bias**: Optional bias in attention projections
- **Benefits**: Improved model flexibility

## Experiment Configurations

### Baseline Configuration
- Standard multi-head attention
- No DeepSeek features
- Serves as control group

### LoRA Configuration
- LoRA-style Q/K/V projections
- Reduced parameter count
- Tests efficiency gains

### Flash Attention Configuration
- LoRA projections + Flash Attention 2
- Tests memory efficiency

### RoPE Scaling Configuration
- LoRA + Flash Attention + RoPE scaling
- Tests long sequence handling

### Full DeepSeek Configuration
- All DeepSeek features enabled
- Maximum feature integration
- Tests combined benefits

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Metrics
- **Validation Loss**: Lower is better
- **Validation Accuracy**: Higher is better
- **Validation Perplexity**: Lower is better
- **Training Time**: Efficiency measure

### Key Questions
1. Do LoRA projections improve efficiency without hurting performance?
2. Does Flash Attention provide memory benefits?
3. Does RoPE scaling help with longer sequences?
4. What's the combined effect of all features?
