Building great things is not easy. It's a decades long journey.

It requires scientific rigor - or our science will be bad.

If you want real top AI research lab experience, here it is:

1. Do not submit AI generated code or pull requests that you didn't read / understand / review / edit.
2. Reviewers can quickly tell low-effort, unreviewed AI output from quality workâ€”especially in PR descriptions. Clearly and concisely explain what you did, why, and how, even if the experiment failed / result was negative - those are also valuable.
3. Make your first 1-2 sentences show the value of your contribution.
4. Ask thoughtful, relevant questions.
5. If you didn't read your AI generated text / code, don't expect others.
6. Don't create low quality contributions just to appear as contributor (eg. "typo fix").
